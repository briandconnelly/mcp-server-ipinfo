# IP Geolocation MCP Server

This is a simple [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that uses the [ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io) API to get detailed information about an IP address.
This information can provide information about where the user is located and the network that they are using.
